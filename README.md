# CS300_FInal_Project

The program is a course planner that allows users to input and store information about college courses in a binary search tree. The program reads in course information from a text file and creates the binary search tree. The user can then interact with the program using a menu to either print the course list or search for a specific course and see its description and prerequisites. The program also includes error handling for invalid user input and file input.
